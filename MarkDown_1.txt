1: git add -p
So you’ve been hacking away all day on some changes, then you add all of them with git add . or git add -A.

Oh, the irony.

Leaving aside the heavy handed nature of these commands, you spent all that time crafting changes just to throw them in the Git repository. It’s like preparing a nice meal, then shoving it all in your mouth at once.

When I complete my changes, I prefer running git add -p. The -p stands for patch. Running this command allows you to interactively review each of your changes. In doing so you can decide if you want to add the change or not.

While more time consuming than git add ., it’s well worth it. More often than not I find some changes I probably don’t want to commit – a comment or debug statement. git add -p provides a final review to ensure my changes are ready to be committed.
